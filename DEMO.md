## Demo video (90 seconds)

The submission asks for a 1–2 minute video. This is the shot list; the long
walkthrough below is the version to give a live audience.

**Before recording:** `cd frontend && npm run dev`, connect with **Dev key →
Create + fund**, and do one throwaway swap so the event feed has content. Soroban
RPC only serves events for a limited ledger window, so a feed with nothing in it
usually means the last swap was simply too long ago.

| Time | On screen | Say |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0:00–0:10** | Live demo URL, swap page loaded | "Stellar Studio — four Soroban contracts on testnet, arranged as two cross-contract pairs." |
| **0:10–0:30** | Type `25` in Sell, quote fills, hit Swap, panel walks Validate → Quote → Registry → DEX swap → Done | "The quote is live from Horizon. One click submits two transactions: the registry validates and records, then the swap settles on the classic DEX." |
| **0:30–0:45** | Point at Registry events: new row, `fee … (30bps)` | "That fee wasn't computed by the registry — it asked `fee_vault` during the same invocation. One transaction, two contracts, events from both." |
| **0:45–1:05** | `/mint`: drop an image, CID appears, pick **The pool**, mint, gallery and NFT events update | "The image goes to IPFS, the CID on chain. Minting into the pool has `nft_collection` call `nft_pool` — again one transaction, two contracts." |
| **1:05–1:20** | DevTools at 390px, then set Sell to `0` and show the error | "Responsive down to phone width. Contract errors are decoded, not raw — this one is `Error(Contract, #3)`, InvalidAmount, caught in simulation so it costs nothing." |
| **1:20–1:30** | GitHub Actions tab, green run | "CI runs fmt, clippy, 72 contract tests and 56 frontend tests, builds the wasm, and deploys the frontend on every push." |

**Recording tips**

* 1280×720 or larger, browser zoom at 100%.
* Do the swap **before** you start recording once, to warm the RPC — a cold
  first quote can take a few seconds and eats a third of your budget.
* If a swap fails on slippage mid-take, that's a fine thing to show: the panel
  names the stage that failed. Don't cut it, explain it.

Paste the finished link into the **Live demo** section of the README.

## 0. Setup (before the demo)

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Leave it a few seconds so the orderbook and the
event feed populate — the skeletons are worth showing, but only once.

---

## 1. The tests pass (30s)

```bash
cargo test
```

> 72 tests across four contracts. Twenty-five of them register the *real*
> counterpart contract in the test host, so every cross-contract path is
> exercised rather than mocked.

```bash
cd frontend && npm run test:run
```

> 56 assertions over the error taxonomy, the stroop maths, and the IPFS CID
> derivation. These caught a real bug: a fee error was being reported as an
> insufficient balance.

---

## 2. Two contracts, one invocation (90s)

This is the centrepiece. Show that a single call fans out across contracts.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
R=CCRQPERNC67KO2QLWDUAGBC5GAGL5JEC4HCM5HQIXVCXT7QU7FQLZGMM
V=CC6AATAR2D2M6J6BQL6E7DXNS25THEVX76363DSPCFNKG2Y3U6J3IUY4
D=$(stellar keys address deployer)

# The two contracts point at each other — mutual, admin-gated trust.
stellar contract invoke --id $R --source deployer --network testnet -- fee_vault
stellar contract invoke --id $V --source deployer --network testnet -- registry
```

> The registry knows the vault; the vault knows the registry. Neither trusts the
> other implicitly — both links are admin-only.

```bash
# Volume before
stellar contract invoke --id $V --source deployer --network testnet -- \
  volume_of --user $D

# One call to the registry
stellar contract invoke --id $R --source deployer --network testnet --send=yes -- \
  record_swap --user $D --sell_asset XLM --buy_asset USDC \
  --amount_in 1000000000 --min_out 950000000
```

> Two events from one invocation: `fee_vault` emitted `accrued`, and
> `swap_registry` emitted `swap` carrying `fee_bps: 30` — a value it did not
> compute itself, it asked the vault for it.

```bash
# Volume after — the vault's state changed as a side effect
stellar contract invoke --id $V --source deployer --network testnet -- \
  volume_of --user $D
stellar contract invoke --id $V --source deployer --network testnet -- total_fees
```

> If a read looks stale, run it again. Horizon and the Soroban RPC index ledgers
> independently, which is exactly the lag the frontend has to handle.

---

## 3. Error handling (90s)

**Contract errors** — rejected during simulation, so they cost no fee:

```bash
# #3 InvalidAmount
stellar contract invoke --id $R --source deployer --network testnet --send=yes -- \
  record_swap --user $D --sell_asset XLM --buy_asset USDC --amount_in 0 --min_out 1

# #5 IdenticalAssets
stellar contract invoke --id $R --source deployer --network testnet --send=yes -- \
  record_swap --user $D --sell_asset XLM --buy_asset XLM \
  --amount_in 1000000000 --min_out 950000000

# #4 SlippageTooHigh — 50% slippage, past the 10% cap
stellar contract invoke --id $R --source deployer --network testnet --send=yes -- \
  record_swap --user $D --sell_asset XLM --buy_asset USDC \
  --amount_in 1000000000 --min_out 500000000
```

**Cross-contract authorisation** — the vault rejects anyone but the registry:

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id $V --source deployer --network testnet --send=yes -- \
  accrue --caller $D --user $D --amount 1000000000 --asset XLM
```

> `Error(Contract, #4)` — `UnauthorizedCaller`. Only the registered registry can
> accrue volume, even though I am the admin.

**In the UI** — show all four classes render distinctly:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run e2e:errors
```

> Validation, contract, network, wallet. Each with its own label, message and
> expandable technical detail. The fallback includes the raw payload, so an
> unrecognised error is still diagnosable.

---

## 4. A real swap in the browser (90s)

In the UI: **Dev key → Create + fund** (Friendbot), then swap 25 XLM → USDC.

Narrate the staged status panel as it advances:

> Validate → Quote → Registry → DEX swap → Done. Five stages, and the panel says
> which one is running. The Registry step is where the cross-contract call
> happens; the DEX step is the actual `path_payment_strict_send` against real
> orderbook liquidity.

When it completes, point at the event feed:

> The new swap appears in the feed with the fee the vault quoted — `fee 0.3
> (30bps)`. That number came from a different contract, in the same transaction.

Both explorer links at the bottom of the panel are live.

Or run it headlessly:

```bash
npm run e2e:swap
```

---

## 5. NFT: mint, IPFS, and the pool (2m)

Switch to the **Mint NFT** tab.

> Same wallet — the connection is shared across pages.

**Upload.** Drag an image in.

> The file is validated in the browser, then pinned to IPFS. There is no Pinata
> key configured here, so instead the CID is computed locally from the file's
> bytes — a real CIDv1, the identifier `ipfs add --cid-version=1 --raw-leaves`
> would produce. The badge says "IPFS not pinning" so nobody is misled: the
> content address on chain is genuine, only the hosting is skipped.

**Name it**, then pick **The pool** and mint.

> One transaction, two contracts. The collection mints the token already owned by
> the pool, then calls `on_deposit` so the pool indexes it. The NFT never passes
> through my wallet.

Point at the event feed:

> Both events, from one click: `MINTED` from the collection and `DEPOSITED` from
> the pool.

Now mint one to **My wallet**, then press **Add to pool** on it.

> The reverse direction: the pool calls `transfer` on the collection to pull the
> token in. Ownership moves first, then the index — so the pool can never claim a
> token it does not hold.

Show the CLI equivalent, including the authorisation check:

```bash
N=CBMIQ343QRVOUGXE7OUPCZNNYGWBDWMS56UALN5NIHWZALN6IDYYYEUV
P=CBADR5KPKYFMMMMOUWYIZXZ4NZGRWTNPJEUQN6OLGU52OLWALT2CKTZG

# Who owns token 1? The pool contract, not a person.
stellar contract invoke --id $N --source deployer --network testnet -- \
  owner_of --token_id 1

# Try to tell the pool it holds a token, without being the collection.
stellar contract invoke --id $P --source deployer --network testnet --send=yes -- \
  on_deposit --caller $D --token_id 99 --depositor $D
```

> `Error(Contract, #3)` — `Unauthorized`. Only the linked collection may call
> `on_deposit`. Without that check anyone could poison the pool's index.

Or run the whole flow headlessly:

```bash
npm run e2e:mint
```

---

## 6. Mobile (30s)

Open devtools → device toolbar → iPhone SE (375px).

> Single column, full-width wallet buttons and nav, 44px touch targets, and the
> NFT grid reflows to two columns. Inputs stay at 16px so iOS doesn't zoom on
> focus, and safe-area insets keep content clear of the notch. No horizontal
> overflow on either page at 375, 390 or 768px.

---

## 7. CI/CD and deployment (60s)

```bash
cat .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

> Every push runs `cargo fmt --check`, clippy with `-D warnings`, all 72
> contract tests, a wasm build with size reporting, then the frontend
> typecheck, lint, unit tests and build. Both jobs upload artifacts.

```bash
cat .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

> Deploy is `workflow_dispatch` only — never on push. It's scoped to a GitHub
> environment so the secret is gated, and a concurrency group stops two runs
> racing for the same sequence number.

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --help 2>/dev/null || head -30 scripts/deploy.sh
```

> One command deploys all four contracts, initializes each, links both pairs in
> both directions and verifies every link before writing `deployment.json`. It
> retries
> the transient RPC failures that break naive deploy scripts — stale sequence
> numbers, "Wasm does not exist" before the upload settles, connection resets.

---

## Talking points if asked

**Why four contracts?** Two pairs, each splitting policy from state. The
registry decides whether a swap is *allowed*, the vault what it *costs*; the
collection owns NFT metadata and ownership, the pool owns custody. The NFT pair
also calls in both directions, which the swap pair does not.

**Why two contracts?** The registry decides whether a swap is *allowed*; the
vault decides what it *costs*. Fee policy can change — new rates, new tiers —
without redeploying the contract holding the swap history. The registry declares
the vault's interface with `#[contractclient]` rather than importing the crate,
so they stay independently deployable.

**Why is the swap not atomic?** The registry call and the DEX settlement are
separate transactions. Making them atomic would require routing funds through a
Soroban contract, which means giving up the classic orderbook — the thing that
provides the real liquidity. The UI reports exactly which stage failed and links
both transactions.

**Hardest bug?** Swaps failed intermittently with `txBadSeq`. A swap submits up
to three transactions back to back, and Horizon and the Soroban RPC index
ledgers independently — so whichever one was asked for the next sequence number
could be behind. The fix reads both and builds on the higher, retrying until the
sequence actually advances. Neither error code was mapped either, so it surfaced
as "Unexpected error".

**Are fees collected?** No — quoted and accounted, not custodied. Charging them
would need a token transfer inside the swap, which is a materially different and
custodial design.
